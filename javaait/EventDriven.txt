Using The AWT/Swing Libraries To
Develop GUI Based Applications.

A GUI Based Application renders a
window with graphical components to
the user.
The user interacts with the GUI 
components. (Example : Clicks on
a button).
This causes an "event".
On event an associated method executes.

This approach to application development
is called as "Event Driven Programming".
