Layout Managers

Layout Managers are used by 
containers (JFrame, Applet, JPanel)
to size and to position the added 
components (JButton, JLabel, ...).

Primary Layout Managers are :
* FlowLayout
* BorderLayout
* GridLayout

FlowLayout
Arranges (positions and sizes) the
components rowwise from left to right.
A new row starts as the current row
becomes full.
Every component gets preferred size.
 

BorderLayout 
Splits the window in 5 parts, named
as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH
and CENTER.
It allows addition of 5 components.
Extra added components will pile up
on the previous added component.


GridLayout 
Splits the window into a grid of
specific rows and cols.
It allows addition of 1 component
in one cell of the grid.
All components get same size i.e. the
size of the cell of grid.
